    <h2>Merchant Listing Guidelines</h2>

    <p>
      The following guidelines are designed to ensure merchant listing
      submissions safeguard our community and offer a consistent and
      expected listing experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      In essence, this process is the vetting of the merchant. Make sure
      to visit the merchant's link and investigate the website to
      ascertain whether it's a safe and honest listing for the community
      to interact with. Pay particular attention to any URL redirects, as
      well as the destinations of any links on the website.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>MERCHANT ID:</b> This id is
        generated by our script and should already be unique. Ensure the
        id doesn't already exist in `merchants.yml`.
      </li>

      <li><b>MERCHANT NAME:</b> Must be fewer
        than 35 characters, with no special characters allowed.
      </li>

      <li><b>MERCHANT DESCRIPTION:</b> The
        description should concisely and clearly depict the merchant.
        Check for any vulgar or disparaging language. If the submitted
        description is insufficient, refine it before approving the
        listing.
      </li>

      <li><b>LISTING LINK URL:</b> Visit the
        provided website. Confirm that the correct URL was used and it
        does not redirect to an unexpected website. Inspect the website
        code to ensure it is not malicious and is safe for visitors.
      </li>

      <li><b>LISTING IMAGE FILENAME</b> and <b>LISTING IMAGE</b> The file name must correspond <i>EXACTLY</i> to the filename
        of the submitted image. Ensure the image is of good quality and
        relevant to the listing. Compress large images prior to
        uploading. If a low-quality image was provided, consider creating
        a higher quality or more fitting image for the listing from
        their website.
      </li>

      <li><b>TAGS:</b> Review the selected tags
        for relevance. Modify the tag list by removing or adding more
        suitable tags. While it's possible to add new tags, think
        carefully before doing so as an excessive number of tags can
        lead to a suboptimal user experience.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Other Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      While the above-mentioned points form the basis of our review
      process, the following additional factors should also be taken
      into consideration:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>LEGAL COMPLIANCE:</b> While we
        cannot know the laws of all jurisdictions, check if the merchant
        generally complies with relevant legal requirements. Obvious
        illegal activity (drug sales, sex services, etc.) should not be
        allowed.
      </li>

      <li><b>SOCIAL:</b> Verify the merchant's
        social media presence and check the reviews, comments, and
        ratings from customers. While no social presence is required, it
        could provide insights into the merchant's reputation.
      </li>

      <li><b>SECURITY:</b> Assess the security
        of the merchant's website. Confirm the use of HTTPS and ensure
        there are no security warnings. Consider using a website security
        scanning tool for a more comprehensive review.

        </ol>
      </li>

      <li><b>PAYMENT METHODS:</b> Ensure that
        the merchant accepts ARRR as a payment method.
      </li>

      <li><b>LEGAL COMPLIANCE:</b> Verify that
        the merchant complies with relevant legal requirements, such as
        terms and conditions, privacy policies, and industry-specific
        regulations.
      </li>

      <li><b>UNEXPECTED DOWNLOADS:</b> Check
        for any unexpected or automatic downloads that initiate when
        visiting the merchant's website.
      </li>
